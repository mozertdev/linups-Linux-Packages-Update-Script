CHANGELOG - Version 0.1 (beta) linups (2025-04-12)
---------------------------------------------

* **New Features:**
    * **2025-04-12 (initial_release) Package Management Implementation:**
        * Introduced core functionality to manage installed packages across
        various Linux distributions. This includes updating, fixing, and
        cleaning packages for the following package managers: APT, DNF, YUM,
        PACMAN, ZYPPER, FLATPAK, SNAP, and BREW (Homebrew). The implementation
        leverages conditional logic based on environment detection to execute
        the appropriate package manager commands.
        
    * **2025-04-12 (initial_release) Logging Subsystem Implementation:**
        * Implemented a configurable logging subsystem controlled by the
        `LOG_MODE` variable. When enabled, the script initializes a log file
        (`linups_log.log` by default) within its execution directory. Users can
        customize the log file path via `LOG_DIR` (expecting an absolute path)
        and the filename via `LOG_FILE`. Input validation ensures that custom
        path and filename variables are enclosed in double quotes as a
        prerequisite for proper string handling within the shell environment.
        
    * **2025-04-12 (initial_release) Internationalization (i18n) Framework:**
        * Established a basic i18n framework supporting English, Portuguese
        (Brazil), and Spanish. This initial implementation likely involves
        separate language files or in-script variable mapping to provide
        localized output for user-facing messages. Future iterations will focus
        on more robust localization libraries or techniques.
        
    * **2025-04-12 (initial_release) Localization (l10n) Auto-Detection:**
        * Implemented an initial localization mechanism that attempts to
        automatically detect the system's language settings. The `SYSTEM_LANG`
        variable allows manual override. The current implementation supports
        `en_US` (default fallback), `pt_BR`, and `es_ES` locale codes, ensuring
        a baseline level of language adaptation based on the execution environment.

**Known Issues & Future Considerations:**

* This is the initial beta release; therefore, unexpected behavior and bugs are
anticipated. Comprehensive testing across various Linux distributions and package
manager versions is ongoing.

* The i18n and l10n frameworks are in their early stages. Future development will
focus on expanding language support and refining the localization logic for edge
cases.

* The logging subsystem provides basic file-based logging. Future enhancements may
include configurable log levels and integration with system logging facilities.

**Developer Notes:**

* This release marks the foundational implementation of core package management,
logging, and basic internationalization/localization features. Subsequent releases
will incrementally build upon this foundation with a focus on stability, expanded
functionality, and user feedback. Please report any encountered issues or feature
requests.
